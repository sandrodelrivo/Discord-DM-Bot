## Commands

#### $gen item [number] [name - optional]
Example: _gen item 1_

Skeleton Key

Item Type:  Object 

Magic Effect: Knowledge of the Skeleton Key will answer all locks, magically.
Backstory: The creator of this key is unknown. There are sages who believe that it was first forged in the time of the Demon Wars, when the might of the Eldens kept Brevia safe from the horrors that ravaged the rest of the world. Others believe that its original creator was a great wizard-king who locked away an ancient deity within a castle and hid the key away for his heirs to unlock generations later.
but be careful, as anyone who can figure out the key can open a secret door to another realm, one of a very different nature.
